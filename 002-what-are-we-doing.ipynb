    "We will also assign different weights to each tag. From 1 to 5. The tags above are listed from highest (artwork) to lowest (museum). This should make our analysis interesting. We will calculate a score by performing a weighted count for each of the sites found per city. Finally we will normalize our count by dividing it by the total population of the city."
